<h2>Thermodynamics simulation from AP chem</h2>
<p>When atoms or molecules bounce they are basically exchange velocity equivelent to an elastic collision</p>
<br/>
<p>I got the equation for 3d elastic collissions of spheres from <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/collision.htm">here</a>, I don't really understand the proof other than the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations but I implemented the vector math and it works. There is also a similar equation from this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#Two-dimensional">wikipedia page</a> on 2d elastic collissions, but because they just use vectors as a whole and not their individual compnents, applying the same equation to 3d also works perfectly, intentional or not. I only use the first one because it's proof is based of thermodynamics and kinetic energy but they are probably the exact same equation just in different form.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution#Distribution_function">equation</a> for the maxwell boltzman distribution is</p>
  $$ f(v) = {({m \over 2\pi kT})^{3/2}}4\pi v^2e^{-{{mv^2} \over {2kT}}}$$
<br/>
where
<br/>
$f(v)$ is the probability
<br/>
$v$ is the velocity
<br/>
$m$ is the mass
<br/>
$k$ is the boltzmann constant
<br/>
$T$ is the temperature
<br/>
<p>the blue graph isn't actually exactly the correct equation for this system since the units didn't convert nicely when I did it. It is also graphed poorly since it is in the fragment shader but when displayed is scaled in the y direction 8 times so it looks stretched, but it would be really hard to fix for not much extra readability and it already seems to fit the bar graph pretty well.</p>
<br/>
<p>the bar graph starts form a velocity of zero and each bucket is 1/700 distance units per 1/30th of a second since it does one physics tick per frame which is 1/30th of a second. The units of velocity are quite small since one unit of distance is one square on the cage, or see it as the floor is 4x4 units</p>
<br/>
<p>basically just shows the maxwell botzman distribution as an emergent propery</p>

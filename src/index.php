<p>Welcome to my website.  I am a high school senior at <a href="https://hpa.edu">HPA</a> in Waimea, Hawaii.</p>
<p>I will go to college next year, and I plan to major in computer science.</p>
<p>This website has many projects that I have worked on in the past few years, including my senior capstone project, an agricultural robot.</p>
  <p>My interests include programming, electronics, robotics, artificial intelligence,  embedded systems, 3D-graphics, physical simulations, and sustainable agriculture.</p>
